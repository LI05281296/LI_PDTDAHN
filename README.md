# PDTDAHN
This repository provides the data and codes for the model PDTDAHN, which can predict drug-target-disease triple associations. A heterogeneous network is constructed, which contains drugs, target proteins, and diseases as nodes and six association types (drug-disease, drug-target, disease-target, drug-drug, target-target, disease-disease associations) as edges. The network embedding algorithm, Mashup, was adopted to extract feature representations of drugs, targets, and diseases from this network. The LightGBM is adopted as the prediction engine.
